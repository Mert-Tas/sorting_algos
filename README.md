Implementation of various sorting algorithms in a DLL project

This project includes the implementation of the various sorting algorithms written in C++.
The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort and its recursive implementation
4. Shell Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Heap Sort
8. Bucket Sort
9. Radix Sort

This is also an example of a DLL project created using Code::Blocks.
Everything needed to create a DLL project and import it to another project is
explained in the file "CodeBlocks_Create_Dll.doc"
